This document describes a 32-bit floating point encoding of ACES for use within color grading systems. 

Equivalent functions may be used for implementation purposes as long as correspondence of grading parameters to this form of log implementation is properly maintained. This document is intended as a guideline to aid developers who are integrating an ACES workflow into a color correction system.
