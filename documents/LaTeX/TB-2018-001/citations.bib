@article{Ohno2014,
    abstract = {Correlated color temperature (CCT) is often used to represent chromaticity of white light sources, but chromaticity is two-dimensional, and another dimension, the distance from the Planckian locus, is often missing. Duv is defined in ANSI C78.377 for this purpose but is not yet widely used. In this article, the use of a combination of CCT and Duv is proposed as an intuitive expression of chromaticity of white light sources for general lighting. In addition, this article presents practical calculation methods to calculate CCT and Duv, having sufficient accuracy, within an error of 1 K, in a wide range of chromaticity, from 1000 to 20,000 K in CCT and -0.03 to 0.03 in Duv.},
