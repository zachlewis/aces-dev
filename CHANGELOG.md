  * Update filenames have been to conform to the ACES System Versioning Specification
  * RRT     
      *  Add a new set of rendering primaries to improve gradeability and vectorscope behavior.  The new primaries, known as AP1, are near the spectrum locus but exceed anticipated device gamuts, including ITU-R BT.2020 at a range of white points.  
      * Modify the global desaturation to apply in RGB space prior to the RRT tone scale.  This was done to improve the overall look of the images based on end-user feedback.
    * Modify The red modifier and glow module variables have been modified.  This was done to improve the overall look of the images based on end-user feedback. 
      * Add a clip of negative values prior to the application of the 3x3 matrix that converts ACES to the rendering primaries. This is added to avoid an error that can occur with negative and saturated ACES values turning positive and saturated.
    * Modify the RRT tone scale to address end-user concerns that the default rendering in v0.7.1 unnecessarily crushed shadow detail
    * Modify the output luminance of an 18% scene reflector from 5.0 nits to 4.8 nits to slightly darken the overall image in response to end-user feedback     
      * Remove the hue restore function to improve grading behavior and address rare instances where image noise could be enhanced.
      * Modify the RRT tone scale to allow for the use of b-splines in the new HDR ODTs.

  * Bug fixes:
    * Correct the value for a constant in the F65-F55 10-bit IDTs
    * Correct the forward Rec2020 ODTs which were applying the inverse tonescale

**Version 0.7 (January 31, 2014):**

  * Update RRT (forward and inverse):
    * Removal of rendering primaries to address a bug which can occur during exposure grading. Tone scale application is performed directly on ACES RGB.
    * Replacement of the red chroma scaling step with an alternate algorithm to modify reds. This algorithm darkens red colors instead of reducing chroma.
    * Addition of a "glow module", which provides a modest lightening and saturation boost in colored shadow regions.
  * Update ODTs (forwards and inverses):
    * Removal of rendering primaries to address a bug which can occur during exposure grading. Tone scale application is performed directly on OCES RGB.
    * Add new math in the ODT tone scale application to preserve more highlight saturation. 
    * Add Device code value clamping at 1.0, followed by a hue-restore step. 
    * Change in clipping behavior for the Rec709 and rgbMonitor ODTs to produce a closer visual approximation to image appearance on a digital cinema projector.
  * Refactor code to centralize functions common to more than one transform. This removes redundancy and makes the differences between various transforms easier to identify for implementers.  
  * Update IDTs:
    * Update ARRI Alexa IDTs - Modify sensor-RGB-to-ACES matrices for nitpickers. ACES diff ~0.00x; LAB diff after RRT + rgbMonitor ODT ~0.0000x.
    * Update the Sony IDTs - Update F35 ODTs to use the piecewise S-Log1 function. Include F65/F55 IDTs for daylight and tungsten.
